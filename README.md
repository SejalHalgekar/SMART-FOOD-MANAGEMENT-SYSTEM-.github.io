### Hello, I'm Sejal 👋

I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and making an impact through creative solutions. 
Here's a glimpse into my journey:  


## 🛠 Projects

### Smart Food Management System  

OVERVIEW:  
A Smart Food Management System (SFMS) utilizes technologies like IoT, 
AI, and machine learning to optimize food tracking, storage, and consumption.
It features real-time inventory management, smart refrigeration, waste reduction,
and AI-driven meal planning. The system tracks expiration dates, reduces food waste,
and provides personalized meal suggestions based on available ingredients.
SFMS helps improve efficiency in homes, restaurants, and supermarkets, 
ensuring fresh food, minimizing waste, and promoting sustainability 
while enhancing cost savings and convenience for users.

Technical Stack:  

- Languages: C++, Java  
- Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
- Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques  

Impact:  
A Smart Food Management System (SFMS) significantly reduces food waste, 
optimizes inventory, and enhances food sustainability. By leveraging IoT,
AI, and data analytics, it improves food tracking, minimizes spoilage,
and promotes efficient consumption. SFMS helps users and businesses save
costs by managing expiration dates, automating reordering, and suggesting
meals based on available ingredients. Additionally, it promotes healthier
eating habits and reduces environmental impacts by curbing overproduction and waste.
Overall, SFMS fosters more efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective food practices
across households, restaurants, and supply chains.
